1. create EC2 instance

    url =  https://github.com/andrewpuch/code_deploy_example

    1.) When server is booted run the following commands as root.

    yum -y update

    yum install -y aws-cli

    cd /home/ec2-user

    2.) Here you will setup your AWS access, secret, and region.

    aws configure

    aws s3 cp s3://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1/latest/install . --region us-east-1

    chmod +x ./install

    3.) This is simply a quick hack to get the agent running faster.

    sed -i "s/sleep(.*)/sleep(10)/" install

    ./install auto

    4.) Verify it is running.

    service codedeploy-agent status


2. connect to your EC2
    Click connect in the EC2 instance

3. start deploy your codes----EB
